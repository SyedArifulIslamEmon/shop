You have to add your API key in Constants.swift in order to receive exchange rates.

Possible improvements:
- caching of exchange rates response
- multi language support
- undo/redo action on basket
- add images for products
- enable https connection only (currently there is an exception, because currency layer's free plan only supports http)
- add more error case unit test
- make currency list more dynamic
- add more design/style to product cell, product detail and cart views
- add search feature for product list and exchange currency list
- add fastlane to the project
- add continuous integration
- add user management
- setup git flow
- dynamic product list (product infos coming form a web service)
